add gravity to the ball's Y velocity

update x and y coordinates for the ball

check that the X coordinate plus it's radius isn't more than the 
canvas width
	if it is, set the coordinate to the canvas width minus radius
	and then update the velocity by setting it to 90% of itself
	based on elasticity properties (how bouncy it is)
	

check that the Y coordinate plus it's radius isn't more than the 
canvas height
	do the same as was done for the X coordinate
